# Mixed Messages

This small app creates random messages from random dogs.

Click on a dog picture and see what it's trying to say to you. 

Each message consists of five parts:
1. The dog's mood
2. The dog's breed
3. The dog's action
4. The verb used for talking
5. The message itself

Dogs that look like they convey a negative emotion use negative-colored verbs to talk, and the same stands for positive-looking dogs. Still, they are all very good dogs, so the messages they convey are nice and supportive.

Example of a message:

*You're walking past a dog park and feel the need to speak to someone. Pick a dog to talk to:*

* small
* medium
* large

==> 

*Playful chihuahua bounds to you and whispers: "Don't worry, you're going to do just fine!"*

*An excited bichon frise bounds to you and baroofs: "Please stop talking to dogs, this is worrying"*
