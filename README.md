# Mixed Messages

This program creates random messages form dogs around you.
Click on a dog picture and see what it's trying to say to you. 
Each message consists of three parts:
1. The dog's breed
2. The dog's mood
3. The message itself

Example of a message:
You're walking past a dog park and feel the need to speak to someone. Pick a dog to talk to:
small
medium
large
==> 
*Playful chihuahua bounds to you and whispers: "Don't worry, you're going to do just fine!"*
*A excited bichon frise bounds to you and baroofs: "Please stop talking to dogs, this is worrying"*
